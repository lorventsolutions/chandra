# Installation

**If you are starting a new project, better go with** [**Fresh installation**](https://lorvent.gitbooks.io/chandra/content/laravel51/fresh_installation.html)

But if you wish, you can still follow this guide.

We assume you are doing a fresh installation.

Incase you are using Chandra in an existing laravel project, please follow guide and avoid steps which you have implemented already.

## Install Laravel

Chandra doesn't ship with whole laravel files, so you need to install laravel yourself.

You can use any of methods mentioned in [laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/installation)

our preferred method is to install using composer by executing

`composer create-project laravel/laravel your_project_name`

## Upgrading from Laravel 4

Since laravel has changed a lot in laravel 5.1, we are not providing any direct way of upgrading to laravel 5.1 from 4.

If you really want to do that, please follow [official guidelines](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/upgrade) or follow [Matt Stauffer's](http://mattstauffer.co/blog/upgrading-from-laravel-4-to-laravel-5) guide.
