# Copying Chandra files

Since we have setup database, mail etc. its time to copy files from downloaded folder to your laravel5 installation.

## Copying to existing project

If you are planning to use Chandra into your existing Laravel project, then please copy required code from

```text
app/Http/routes.php
```

into your routes.php to avoid any un-necessary problems.

**Check all other files yourself and copy only required files.**
