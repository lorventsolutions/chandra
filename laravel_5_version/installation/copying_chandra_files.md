# Copying Chandra Files

Copy files from downloaded folder to your laravel5 installation.

## Copying to existing project

If you are planning to use Chandra into your existing Laravel project, then please copy required code from `app/Http/routes.php` into your routes.php to avoid any un-necessary problems.

Check all other files yourself and copy only required files.
